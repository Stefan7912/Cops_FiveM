```lua
TriggerEvent("es_em:cl_ResPlayer")

```lua
RegisterServerEvent('gc:copOpenIdentity')

    local data = getIdentity(other)
    if data ~= nil then
        TriggerClientEvent('gc:showItentity', source, {
            nom = data.nom,
            prenom = data.prenom,
            sexe = data.sexe,
            dateNaissance = tostring(data.dateNaissance),
            jobs = data.jobs,
            taille = data.taille
        })
    end
end)
```
